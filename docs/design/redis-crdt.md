## Summary

**Geo-Distributed Active-Active** deployment for **Keying&Linking** means ability to process *online/streaming/batch* workloads from multiple regions simultaneously.


### Issue

Writes to BigTable(BT) are **evneuvaly consistent** when BT replication is enabled across regions.<br/>
This may lead to data inconsistency when transactions are processed simultaneously in both regions

### Decision

**Read-through** cache sits in-line with the database. When there is a cache miss, it loads missing data from database, populates the cache and returns it to the application.



**read-through / write-through cache**

</p>

With **write-through** cache strategy, data is first written to the cache and then to the database. The cache sits in-line with the database and writes always go through the cache to the main database.

when paired with **read-through** caches, we get all the benefits of **read-through** and we also get data consistency guarantee, freeing us from using cache invalidation techniques.

**read-through / write-behind cache**

</p>

Here, the application writes data to the cache which acknowledges immediately and after some delay, it writes the data back to the database.

**Write-behind** caches improve the write performance and are good for **write-heavy** workloads. When combined with **read-through**, it works good for mixed workloads, where the most recently updated and accessed data is always available in cache.

**read-direct / write-behind cache**

**RedisGears** runs with-in **Redis** and enable updating backend DB when transactions are received by Redis.

Redis multi-cluster  conflict-free replication enables to sync **writes** between regions.

### Status

Not Decided. Open to discussion.


## Details

Replication of BigTable is slow, don't support CRDTs (â€‹conflict-free replicated data types)
